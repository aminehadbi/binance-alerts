# binance-alerts
Tracks relative volume across all the futures pair

Using labeled data through a data analytics script I wrote I am able to classify into clusters the best opportunities and take action from it.


TODO:
Integrate with https://github.com/aranair/rtscli

Note: The script is ran by using 

python3 main all

['1m', '5m', '15m', '1h', '4h'] are also acceptable arguments
